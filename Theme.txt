Color Usage Breakdown
First, let’s establish exactly where to apply the colors:

Primary Color: Rustic Orange (#FF8C00)
This color should be used for the most attention-grabbing elements, as it’s your brand-defining color.

Main Call-to-Actions (CTAs): These are your buttons like “Add to Cart,” “Shop Now,” or “Check Out.” It should be used on buttons you want users to click immediately.
Hero Section/Primary Banner: Use it as a background color or in a prominent button, so it’s one of the first things visitors notice when they land on the site.
Headings and Titles: You can make main headings or section titles stand out with Rustic Orange to create visual interest.
Icons or Important Info: Consider using this color on icons or other small details that need highlighting.
Secondary Color: Deep Olive (#556B2F)
This color is subtle and pairs well with the primary. Use it for areas where you want to keep things grounded but still want them to stand out.

Navigation Bar & Links: Use Deep Olive for your top navigation bar, footer, and links within the navigation. It offers a more natural tone and contrasts well with the bright primary color.
Secondary CTAs: For secondary buttons like “Learn More” or “View Details,” use Deep Olive. These don’t need as much visual weight as the primary CTAs.
Backgrounds for Sections: Use Deep Olive as a background for certain sections (like a "Featured Products" section), offering a grounded and organic feel.
Product Titles or Subheadings: Use Deep Olive for smaller titles or subheadings to create a clean and consistent hierarchy.
Accent Color: Soft Beige (#F5F5DC)
Soft Beige is your light neutral accent, perfect for making certain elements pop without overwhelming the design.

Backgrounds: Use Soft Beige for general backgrounds like the main body of the site. It’s light enough to keep the site feeling airy, clean, and warm, making it perfect for product pages.
Hover States: This color can be used on hover for buttons or links to create a smooth, subtle transition effect. When the user hovers over a button, for example, the background could change to Soft Beige to show interactivity.
Borders and Dividers: Use Soft Beige to create soft borders or dividers between sections, like product cards or between your header and the rest of the page.
Icons or Small Details: Use it for small elements like icons, checkboxes, or separators.
